          prompt: |
            Review and improve the PR description for PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.
            
            Read CLAUDE.md and docs/llm.md to understand the project architecture and conventions.
            
            First, check the current PR description:
            ```bash
            gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json body --jq '.body'
            ```
            
            Then analyze the changes:
            ```bash
            gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }}
            ```
            
            Evaluate the current description:
            - If empty: Generate a complete professional description
            - If present: Assess if it's comprehensive and well-structured
            
            A good PR description should follow this format:
            
            ## Summary
            Brief 1-2 sentence overview of what this PR accomplishes.
            
            ## Changes
            - List key changes made (be specific about files/components modified)
            - Focus on what changed, not how (code speaks for itself)
            - Group related changes together
            
            ## Motivation
            Why was this change needed? What problem does it solve?
            
            ## Testing
            - How can reviewers test this?
            - What scenarios should be verified?
            
            ## Breaking Changes (if any)
            List any breaking changes or migration steps required.

            **IMPORTANT: Check for related issues**
            First, get all open issues:
            ```bash
            gh issue list --repo ${{ github.repository }} --state open --json number,title,body --limit 50
            ```
            
            Analyze which issues this PR might address based on:
            - Changed files
            - Commit messages
            - Issue titles/descriptions matching the changes
            
            If you find related issues, add them to the description in a "Related Issues" section:
            ```markdown
            ## Related Issues
            - Fixes #123
            - Addresses #456
            - Partially resolves #789
            ```
            
            Decision Logic:
            1. If description is empty or just a placeholder → Generate complete description with related issues
            2. If description is present but incomplete/vague → Suggest improvements as a comment
            3. If description is comprehensive → Check if related issues are linked, add them if missing
            
            To update the PR description:
            ```bash
            gh pr edit ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "YOUR_GENERATED_DESCRIPTION"
            ```
            
            To suggest improvements (if description exists but needs work):
            ```bash
            gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "## 📝 PR Description Suggestions\n\nYOUR_SUGGESTIONS_HERE"
            ```
            
            Guidelines:
            - Be concise and professional
            - Use markdown formatting
            - Do NOT use emojis in the description itself (only in suggestion comments)
            - Focus on substance over style
            - Highlight important architectural decisions
            - Note any new dependencies or patterns introduced

            Review PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions and architecture patterns. Read docs/llm.md for detailed project architecture.

            Focus on substantive issues:
            - Code quality, potential bugs, architecture alignment
            - Type safety (no 'any' allowed per project rules)
            - DRY principle violations
            - Testing coverage

            Be concise and professional. Only report actual issues worth addressing.
            Skip generic praise and obvious observations.
            Do NOT use emojis in your review.

            **CRITICAL: You MUST post a review comment in ALL cases**
            - If issues found: Report them with "## Code Review" heading
            - If no issues: Post "## Code Review\n\n✅ No significant issues found. Code quality looks good."
            
            To post your review:
            1. Check for existing comment:
               ```bash
               COMMENT_ID=$(gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "github-actions[bot]") | select(.body | startswith("## Code Review")) | .id' | head -1)
               ```

            2. If COMMENT_ID exists, update it:
               ```bash
               gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID -X PATCH -f body="YOUR_REVIEW_HERE"
               ```

            3. Otherwise create new comment:
               ```bash
               gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "YOUR_REVIEW_HERE" --repo ${{ github.repository }}
               ```

            Start your review with "## Code Review" heading.

            Security review for PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            Read CLAUDE.md for project context, docs/llm.md for detailed project architecture, then scan for security vulnerabilities:
            
            Critical issues to check:
            - SQL injection risks
            - XSS vulnerabilities  
            - Authentication/authorization flaws
            - Insecure data handling
            - Dependency vulnerabilities
            - SSRF attacks
            - DNS rebinding attacks
            - Improper input validation
            - Secrets exposure
            
            Focus on worker/, src/, and shared/ directories.
            
            Reporting guidelines:
            - Only report real vulnerabilities, not theoretical ones
            - Provide specific fix recommendations with code examples
            - Be professional and direct
            - Do NOT use emojis
            
            **CRITICAL: You MUST post a security review comment in ALL cases**
            - If vulnerabilities found: Report them with severity levels and fixes
            - If no vulnerabilities: Post "## Security Review\n\n✅ No security vulnerabilities found. Security posture looks good."
            
            Update existing comment to prevent spam:
            ```bash
            COMMENT_ID=$(gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "github-actions[bot]") | select(.body | startswith("## Security Review")) | .id' | head -1)

              gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID -X PATCH -f body="YOUR_REVIEW_HERE"
            else
              gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "YOUR_REVIEW_HERE" --repo ${{ github.repository }}
            fi
            ```
            
            Start with "## Security Review" heading.
