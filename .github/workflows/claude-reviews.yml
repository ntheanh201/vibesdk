          prompt: |
            Review and improve the PR description for PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.
            
            Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions. Only read docs/llm.md if you need detailed architecture information.
            
            First, check the current PR description:
            ```bash
            gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json body --jq '.body'
            ```
            
            Then analyze the changes:
            ```bash
            gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }}
            ```
            
            Evaluate the current description:
            - If empty: Generate a complete professional description
            - If present: Assess if it's comprehensive and well-structured
            
            A good PR description should follow this format:
            
            ## Summary
            Brief 1-2 sentence overview of what this PR accomplishes.
            
            ## Changes
            - List key changes made (be specific about files/components modified)
            - Focus on what changed, not how (code speaks for itself)
            - Group related changes together
            
            ## Motivation
            Why was this change needed? What problem does it solve?
            
            ## Testing
            - How can reviewers test this?
            - What scenarios should be verified?
            
            ## Breaking Changes (if any)
            List any breaking changes or migration steps required.

            **IMPORTANT: Check for related issues**
            First, get all open issues:
            ```bash
            gh issue list --repo ${{ github.repository }} --state open --json number,title,body --limit 50
            ```
            
            Analyze which issues this PR might address based on:
            - Changed files
            - Commit messages
            - Issue titles/descriptions matching the changes
            
            If you find related issues, add them to the description in a "Related Issues" section:
            ```markdown
            ## Related Issues
            - Fixes #123
            - Addresses #456
            - Partially resolves #789
            ```
            
            Decision Logic:
            1. If description is empty or just a placeholder → Generate complete description with related issues
            2. If description is present but incomplete/vague → Suggest improvements as a comment
            3. If description is comprehensive → Check if related issues are linked, add them if missing
            
            To update the PR description:
            ```bash
            gh pr edit ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "YOUR_GENERATED_DESCRIPTION"
            ```
            
            To suggest improvements (if description exists but needs work):
            First, minimize any old suggestion comments:
            ```bash
            OLD_SUGGESTIONS=$(gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "github-actions[bot]") | select(.body | startswith("## 📝 PR Description Suggestions")) | .id]')
            if [ -n "$OLD_SUGGESTIONS" ]; then
              echo "$OLD_SUGGESTIONS" | jq -r '.[]' | while read comment_id; do
                gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/comments/$comment_id -X PATCH -f body="<details><summary>🔒 Outdated suggestions</summary>\n\nSuperseded by newer suggestions.\n</details>"
              done
            fi
            ```
            Then post new suggestions:
            ```bash
            gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "## 📝 PR Description Suggestions\n\nYOUR_SUGGESTIONS_HERE"
            ```
            
            Guidelines:
            - Be concise and professional
            - Use markdown formatting
            - Do NOT use emojis in the description itself (only in suggestion comments)
            - Focus on substance over style
            - Highlight important architectural decisions
            - Note any new dependencies or patterns introduced
            - **ALWAYS include the disclaimer at the end**: <sub>**This PR description was automatically generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai)**</sub>

            Perform a thorough code quality and security review for PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.
            
            WORKFLOW:
            
            1. Understand context (dig only as needed for this PR)
               - Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
               - Read llm.md only if architectural details are needed
               - Check PR diff to understand scope of changes
            
            2. Comprehensive review (be thorough but efficient)
               Focus on worker/, src/, shared/ directories:
               
               **Code Quality:**
               - Bugs, logical errors, edge cases
               - Type safety violations (no 'any' allowed)
               - DRY principle violations
               - Architecture misalignment
               - Performance issues
               - Missing tests
               
               **Security:**
               - SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities
               - Auth/authorization flaws
               - Insecure data handling
               - Secrets exposure
               - Input validation issues
               - SSRF, DNS rebinding attacks
            
            3. Make recommendation
               - APPROVE: If code meets quality/security standards
               - REQUEST CHANGES: If critical issues found
               - COMMENT: If minor improvements suggested
            
            4. Format review
               ```markdown
               ## Code & Security Review
               
               **Recommendation:** [APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / COMMENT]
               
               ### Code Quality
               [Grouped by severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low OR "✅ No issues"]
               
               ### Security
               [Vulnerabilities with severity OR "✅ No vulnerabilities"]
               
               ### Summary
               [Overall assessment with approval/disapproval reasoning]
               ```
            
            5. Post review (MANDATORY FINAL STEP)
               ```bash
               # Collapse old reviews
               gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "github-actions[bot]") | select(.body | startswith("## Code & Security Review")) | .id' | while read cid; do
                 gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/comments/$cid -X PATCH -f body="<details><summary>Outdated</summary>Superseded</details>" 2>/dev/null || true
               done
               
               # Post new review
               gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "YOUR_REVIEW_HERE"
               ```
            
            GUIDELINES:
            - Be thorough but efficient - dig deeper only where the PR changes warrant it
            - Provide specific examples and fixes for issues found
            - Professional tone, no emojis
            - Must post comment at the end with your findings
